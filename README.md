# Stock-AI
This is simply a website that can be used for advice when buying stocks. This will probably not come up with a good strategy, but you can try it yourself by installing the docker container or by visiting my self hosted version at [here](https://stocks.lschaefer.xyz) (I have taken this down now due to the fact that this was just a learning project).
# Information
This project may or may not get updates. This was jut a quick project to learn react and next js with.
# Docker
To install the docker container first get the docker-compose file by running the command below. Then edit the file to your choosing.
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lukasdotcom/stock-ai/master/docker/docker-compose
```
Finally run the command below to start the container.
```
